# BattleShip
BattleShip with AI's
This is a BattleShip game with AIs that my partner and I coded in my Objected Oritented Programming in C++ class.
It reads from a configuration file that lists the number of rows and columns of the board, and the name and size of each ship for the game. The program also accepts a seed for the random number generator for the AIs.
The game allows for three modes, Human vs Human, Human vs AI, and AI vs AI.
The AI's are Random AIs which randomly select positions to shoot at, Cheating AIs which automatically shoot at ships on your board, and SearchAndDestroy AIs that randomly shoot until they find a ship and then shoot at all positions around the first ship they hit. 
This project uses many foundational Object Oritented Programming principles as well as Inheritence and Polymorphism used for the AIs. 
This project was very tedious and time consuming, and I am so happy with the way it turned out!
